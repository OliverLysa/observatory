# Purpose: Script calculates the outflow routing from the use and collection nodes across the following pathways to estimate a 'circularity rate'
# Inputs:
# Required annual updates:
# The URL to download from (check end June)
# https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-weee-in-the-uk
# Defra's 'waste tracking' system should provide improved numbers for outflow destinations within the regulated waste system when in place
